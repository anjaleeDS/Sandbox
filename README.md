Fun projects for personal use only. Enjoy!

1. miniStock_analysisUsing_FBProphet.ipynb:

Need:
- colab from goog
- a stock that you are interested in seeing if it has any obvious components/characteristics
- gsheet or csv of stock prices. i take a cut of something like https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WMT/history?p=WMT and paste it into a gsheet
- time to noodle around with cleaning the initial data (i tried to do some but you may encounter more)
